You can make sub-directories in the upload directory, and move files into them.

== Description ==

You can make sub-directories in the upload directory, and move files into them. At the same time, this plugin modifies the URLs/path names in the database. Also an alternative file-selector is added in the editing post/page screen, so you can pick up media files from the subfolders easily.

Before try this plugin, I recommend you to backup your contents(files, database) and test this plugin enough. I have tested this plugin with Apache(Liunx/Windows) and IIS Express 7.5. If you cannot get working this plugin, please let me know.
