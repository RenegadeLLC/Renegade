== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Do I need an account with heatmap?**

Yes, but the sign up is easy as you can use your Google or Facebook account to register

In fact, you need to register on [heatmap.me](https://heatmap.me/) as we are using powerful servers and technologies to offer a product that would slow down your WordPress sites if we tried to integrate it as a standalone plugin.


**How much does it cost?**

We have a free plan available to you, with limited features. We also have various paid plans depending on your audience and the number of sites you operate.

**I don't see my clicks when I play with my own site**

To prevent your clicks from polluting your data, the plugin disables the logging engine when you are logged in as admin on your own site. You can test with a different browser if you don't believe us ;)


**Does the plugin impact the performance of my site?**

Not a bit. Our tag is very small and fully asynchronous. Plus, we set up powerful servers and technologies to collect data (we collect hundreds of millions of clicks per month), crunch them and then, display them to you. Finally, the plugin itself stores its configuration using WordPress core engine, so there is no extra load on your WordPress installation.
